Jekyll is pretty rad and figured ren of [my site](http://mademistakes.com)[^1] as a theme for others to hack and build on would be fun. So here be that theme --- I call it **Minimal Mistakes**, a responsive Jekyll theme with large featured images and solid typography. 

## Minimal Mistakes is all about:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers. 
* Minimal embellishments --- content first.
* Large feature images for posts and pages.
* Author sidebar to pimp your bio, photo[^2], and social media links.
* Simple and clear permalink structure *(ie: domain.com/category/post-title)*
